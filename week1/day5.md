### Day 5 : Introduction to Programming ###
1.  Introduction to Languages : C, C++, Java,  Python, Ruby, Go (non-trivial sample in each for them to feel that the variations are not much)
2.  Introduction to Algorithms - from what is an algorithm to what kind of algorithms exist and why a good algorithm is always better than any other optimization ever done.
3.  how to learn a new programming language - start with constants, variables,  datatypes, go to control flows, then OO syntax, followed by more advanced concepts for each language
4.  How to pick your language of choice - what are the opportunities in the market, what works where (front end, backend, web, mobile)
