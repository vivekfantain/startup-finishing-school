### Day 4: Test Day ###
Test students' capabilities on Day 1, Day 2, Day 3 

2 hours each test of 100 objective questions  (yes it is tough but hey this is not school anymore ...)
Test #1 - Computers
Test #2 - Networks
Test #3 - Cloud & Analytics 

Let go of the bottom feeders at this point - make it clear that this is a serious course.
